        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a rising second year Computer Science Major at the University of Maryland College Park. I don't have a strong background in CS as the 
            Google STEP internship is my first professional work experience working with Computer Science; however, Computer Science, for the most part, 
            comes pretty natural to me. As for my personal background, I am of the Oromo ethnic group, where most of its population resides in Ethiopia, including
            my parents at one point, but they immigrated here in 1999. I am also Muslim, a practicer of the second most practiced religion in the world.
